# Mid-Meeting
Created a program in Java that finds the midpoint in a graph and the average distance to be traveled to get there using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

To set it up, make sure the text files are in the same folder as the program files. The program parses through the text files and creates a graph from that data. It then finds the shortest average distance between all the participants and prints out the midpoint with the distance.
